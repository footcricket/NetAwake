# NetAwake: Network-Powered PC Wake-Up Utility ‚è∞

## Overview üìÑ

NetAwake is a powerful networking utility that allows you to remotely power on a PC over the Internet using the Wake-On-LAN protocol. This technology enables you to wake up a computer from a powered-down or sleep state, making it an invaluable tool for IT professionals, home network enthusiasts, and anyone looking to save time and energy.

## Principle of Operation üí°

NetAwake operates by sending a specially crafted network message known as a "magic packet" to the target computer. The magic packet is designed to awaken the target computer from a low-power state, such as being powered down. Here's how it works:

1. **Magic Packet**: The magic packet contains the MAC address of the target computer. This MAC address is a unique identifier for the network interface card (NIC) or Ethernet device in the target computer.

2. **Low-Power Mode**: Computers capable of Wake-on-LAN maintain network devices that can "listen" for incoming packets even when the system is powered down. This low-power mode allows the computer to respond to the magic packet.

3. **Wake-Up Signal**: When the NIC of the target computer receives a magic packet addressed to its MAC address, it signals the computer's power supply or motherboard to initiate system wake-up, similar to pressing the power button.

4. **Broadcast**: The magic packet is sent on the data link layer and is broadcast to all devices on the local network using the network broadcast address. It does not rely on IP addresses.

NetAwake reduces power consumption in powered-down computers, as it only requires the network interface to stay on in low-power mode. Disabling Wake-on-LAN when not needed can further reduce standby power consumption.

## Magic Packet Structure üì¶

The magic packet is a broadcast frame that contains 6 bytes of all 255 (FF FF FF FF FF FF in hexadecimal), followed by sixteen repetitions of the target computer's 48-bit MAC address, resulting in a total of 102 bytes. It can be sent using various network and transport-layer protocols, often as a UDP datagram to port 0, 7, or 9, or directly over Ethernet as EtherType 0x0842.

### Limitations üõë

NetAwake has some limitations that are important to consider:

1. **Requires Destination MAC Address**: You need the MAC address of the destination computer to send a magic packet. In some cases, a SecureOn password may also be required.

2. **No Delivery Confirmation**: Wake-on-LAN does not provide delivery confirmation, so you won't know if the target computer successfully woke up.

3. **Local Network Dependence**: It may not work outside of the local network unless you have set up appropriate network configurations like subnet directed broadcasts or a Wake-on-LAN gateway service.

4. **Hardware Support**: Wake-on-LAN requires hardware support on the destination computer, so not all computers can be woken up using this method.

5. **Wireless Interface Compatibility**: Most 802.11 wireless interfaces do not maintain a link in low-power states, making them unable to receive a magic packet.

## Getting Started üöÄ

To get started with NetAwake, you'll need to ensure that your target computer and network equipment support Wake-on-LAN. While there may not be specific documentation provided for this project, you can follow these general steps:

1. **Configure Your Target Computer**: Access the BIOS or UEFI settings of your target computer to enable Wake-on-LAN functionality. This typically involves enabling the feature in the BIOS settings. Consult your computer's user manual or manufacturer's website for specific instructions.

2. **Ensure Network Settings**: Make sure that your network infrastructure, including your router and switch, supports Wake-on-LAN. Additionally, ensure that the target computer and the device you'll be sending the magic packet from are on the same local network.

3. **Identify the MAC Address**: You'll need the MAC address of the target computer. You can usually find this information in the computer's network settings or on the physical network adapter.

4. **Use a Wake-on-LAN Tool**: There are various Wake-on-LAN tools available for different platforms. You can use one of these tools to send the magic packet to your target computer. These tools usually allow you to specify the target computer's MAC address and IP address.

5. **Send the Magic Packet**: Once your setup is in place and you have a Wake-on-LAN tool ready, send the magic packet to your target computer. The computer should wake up if all the configurations are correct.

Please note that while this project may not provide specific documentation, the general principles of Wake-on-LAN still apply, and you can find additional resources and guides online to assist you in setting up Wake-on-LAN for your specific environment.
